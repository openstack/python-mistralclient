Mistral is a workflow service. Most business processes consist of multiple
distinct interconnected steps that need to be executed in a particular
order in a distributed environment. A user can describe such a process as a set
of tasks and their transitions. After that, it is possible to upload such a
description to Mistral, which will take care of state management, correct
execution order, parallelism, synchronization and high availability.

Mistral also provides flexible task scheduling so that it can run a process
according to a specified schedule (for example, every Sunday at 4.00pm) instead
of running it immediately. In Mistral terminology such a set of tasks and
relations between them is called a workflow.

Mistral client
==============

Python client for Mistral REST API. Includes python library for Mistral API and
Command Line Interface (CLI) library.

Installation
------------

First of all, clone the repo and go to the repo directory::

    $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/python-mistralclient.git
    $ cd python-mistralclient

Then just run::

    $ pip install -e .

or::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install


Running Mistral client
----------------------

If Mistral authentication is enabled, provide the information about OpenStack
auth to environment variables. Type::

    $ export OS_AUTH_URL=http://<Keystone_host>:5000/v2.0
    $ export OS_USERNAME=admin
    $ export OS_TENANT_NAME=tenant
    $ export OS_PASSWORD=secret
    $ export OS_MISTRAL_URL=http://<Mistral host>:8989/v2  (optional, by
      default URL=http://localhost:8989/v2)

and in the case that you are authenticating against keystone over https:

    $ export OS_CACERT=<path_to_ca_cert>

.. note:: In client, we can use both Keystone auth versions - v2.0 and v3. But
          server supports only v3.*

To make sure Mistral client works, type::

    $ mistral workbook-list

You can see the list of available commands typing::

    $ mistral --help
